# Research

Physics has shaped the way I think and approach problems. The materials below are part of my academic background and are kept here as an archive of that process. 

### Main Topics
- Non-perturbative QCD
- Dynamical chiral symmetry breaking
- Axial anomaly and instanton physics
- Hadron physics and effective field theories
- Mathematical physics in nonlinear system
